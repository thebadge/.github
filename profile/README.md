# TheBadge: Decentralized Certification Platform

TheBadge is an innovative decentralized certification platform built on Ethereum's blockchain technology. It empowers users to tokenize real-world information through certifications, known as badges. These badges undergo community-driven verification and validation, ensuring a trustworthy ecosystem.

## What is TheBadge?

At its core, TheBadge is a platform that revolutionizes certification through decentralization. Key features include:

### Certification Generation: 
Badges are generated based on specific criteria and supporting evidence. Each badge issuance requires substantiating evidence.

### Community Verification: 
TheBadge relies on a decentralized community of curators who meticulously review and verify badge authenticity. Curators are incentivized for identifying fraudulent badges.

The Need for Decentralized Certifications
To foster a reliable crypto ecosystem, accurate information is crucial. Decentralization promotes trust, but relying solely on centralized entities for verification can lead to undesirable consequences. TheBadge addresses this by decentralizing the certification process, safeguarding against bad actors.


## Badge Categories

### Community Badges
Represent real-world information in the form of blockchain-based certifications. To obtain a badge, users must provide evidence and pass through TheBadge's curation process, where our community of curators will review and verify the authenticity of the evidence.
For example, a web3 company can apply to get a proof of reserves certification. People from the community can then always verify that this process is transparent.


### Third-Party Badges
Also known as "Blockchain certifications as a service". These are badges generated and backed by a public or private entity. Entities that are willing to generate these badges have to be registered on the platform before they can start emitting them.
For example, an online courses platform could become a third-party entity of TheBadge, by doing so, it will be able to grant its certifications on-chain without having to develop its own mechanism.
